      # How It Works


      ## The Significant Benefits of InShip for Your Customers


      Increasingly, companies are moving to Automated Accounts Payable processing for the simple reason - it saves money. 


      To summarise,

      Manual invoice processing is a time-consuming chore. Often the workflow includes:


      * Opening all supplier envelopes and extracting invoices

      * If invoices are emailed - printing those invoices

      * Sorting the invoices and manually allocating them against relevant POs and GRNs

      * Forwarding the paper invoices to appropriate company employees for approval

      * Keying all invoice data into the company’s ERP/accounting software	

      * Manually reconciling statements to invoices; requesting missing invoices and spotting duplicate invoices

      * Filing and storing all hard copies


      **The Savings with InShip**

      This time-consuming, expensive process, which can include as many as 10 steps per invoice, has been estimated to cost (minimum) €4.50 (US$5.30) per item (source: PWC).

      InShip has been proven to save users between 80 – 90%, compared to manual accounts payable processing. 



      **Why is InShip so Cost-Effective?**

      InShip’s online functionalities eliminate manual Accounts Payable processing by automating associated workflows.


      **Step 1 -** Suppliers email invoices, statements, and related documents to a secure online address


      **Step 2 -** InShip’s cloud-enabled architecture automatically extracts data held in those documents


      **Step 3 -** The data is forwarded to the relevant internal employee for secure, authorized approval


      **Step 4 -**The approval, together with the data, is migrated to the End-Customer’s ERP and/or accounts package for payment, compliance, and financial accounting

      It really is that simple.


      # Intelligent Rules-Based Processing for Flexibility


      Because every business is different, users access the InShip Dashboard to establish specific rules to tailor our solution to their requirements. InShip does not ask users to change their internal processes to meet the InShip solution. Rather, InShip changes its processes to meet end-user needs. 


      Flexible User-Defined Data Capture – InShip captures all data automatically and those data capture requirements can be easily modified by the user. Capture fields can be added, edited, and deleted.

      Benefit:  InShip can be reconfigured as requirements change.


      **Matching POs to GRN–** InShip automatically matches Purchase Orders to Goods Received Notes to ensure that the customer has received exactly what has been ordered.

      **Benefit:** eliminates manual matching; ensures accuracy.


      **Watching for Price Increases –** if prices of specified products / services increase above a set threshold, InShip’s Price Watch function notifies specified stakeholders within the user company. InShip can also provide alternative suppliers based on purchasing histories.

      **Benefit:** eliminates manual research and overview of pricing; increases the likelihood users are receiving the best price for purchased products and services, Simplifying Complex Approval Processes – InShip takes care of this by using pre-established rules set by the user. Examples include requests for approval can be automatically routed by specific sets or sub-sets of products (and their invoices) to specified employees, and/or products purchased in specified geographic markets (or regional areas) can be automatically routed to specified employees within those markets or elsewhere, and/or approval can be routed to a single headquarters office.


      **InShip is flexible -** Its rules-based architecture can be configured to meet the unique approval requirements of most businesses.

      **Benefit:** speeds the approval process while increasing security.


      **Simplified Bulk Approvals –** all documents from one supplier, or all PO matched documents, can be approved with a single click.

      **Benefit:** increased efficiency for larger suppliers, while ensuring approval security.


      **Online Mobile App Approval –** InShip is available as a secure application for use on mobile devices. Authorized users can be granted approval permissions, enabling them to approve invoices remotely.

      **Benefit:** increased efficiency and productivity.


      **Remote Online Access –**  InShip is fully online, it is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, from anywhere in the world. Robust security ensures that only authorized employees can access the company’s InShip website, as well as all supporting documents. 

      **Benefit:** increases efficiency, productivity, and security.


      **Line-by-Line Data Capture –** InShip captures every line of every invoice for deeper insight, while eliminating the need for re-keying data into ERP and accounting systems.

      **Benefit:** speeds all supplier invoice processing while increasing payment and reporting accuracy


      **Automatic Migration to the User’s Accounting Solution –** InShip automatically migrates data into the user’s accounting solution by specified rules (for example: invoice data can be migrated to the General Ledger as well as supplier ledgers. Taxes such as sales taxes / VAT can be migrated to the specified ledger to ensure compliance). 

      **Benefit:** increased efficiency, productivity and accuracy; eliminates data re-keying


      **Automatic Statement Reconciliation –** manual reconciliation of statements against invoices takes hours. InShip eliminates this by automatically reconciling invoices against relevant statements. InShip also detects missing invoicing, and spots double invoicing, prompting appropriate action on the part of the user. 

      **The Benefit:** eliminates hours of manual reconciliation while improving accuracy, and minimizes accidental payment of double invoices


      **Purchase Order Creation –** InShip integrates with many ERP and Accounting packages. However, because some businesses require a supplemental or stand-alone system, InShip can act as a separate solution to create Purchase Orders. In this scenario, InShip can work as a stand-alone system, or in addition to existing ERP and Accounting PO functions. InShip POs are routed according to rules-based instructions, and across a variety of parameters (for example: PO approvals can be routed to specified employees based on suppliers, items purchased, or values).

      **Benefit:** flexible PO functionality increases speed, accuracy, and security


      **Comments –** users can add new, pre-defined, or forced comments onto documents.

      **Benefit:** enhanced user collaboration


      **Seven Years of Invoice History at Users’ Fingertips –** all documents received by InShip into the user’s secure online portal are automatically stored, and accessible, for up to seven years. Older documents are migrated to a relevant Archive. 

      **The Benefit:** simplified search functionalities enable users to find required documents in moments (using a variety of search terms including supplier name, invoice number, date, PO, value, and many others) rather than resorting to a manual search of stored paper files


      **Paperless Automated Accounts Payable –** because supplier invoices and statements are securely stored online, InShip eliminates paper storage requirements.

      **Benefit:** eliminates paper-based storage


      **Document Tracking –** invoices processed by InShip that require approval are tracked. The InShip Dashboard illustrates whose approval is required, and by when. 

      **Benefit:** ‘At-a-Glance’ ability to manage invoice flows, while ensuring timely payments


      **Other Benefits –** InShip is scalable, delivering the flexibility to handle changing user requirements. Our solution also enhances collaboration among users who may be located thousands of miles away. Too, InShip reporting tools work to help users pay suppliers within agreed terms, helping to promote goodwill

      **A Superlative ROI** – InShip significantly reduces the cost of manual processing, while increasing accuracy and payment security. Combining all of the benefits, users discover that InShip provides an exceptional Return on Investment.

    - title: UK Maintenance Company
      theIssue: From its maintenance hub, this UK company supports over 5000 assets
        using a network of 250 suppliers located throughout the country, and
        handles 60 daily breakdowns, 100 services and 20 annual checks.
      theBrief: A system was required that could correctly deal with all the company’s
        supplier invoices and proforma invoices. The system also needed to
        automatically compare these invoices to purchase orders. Additionally,
        they required us to automatically recognise and store backup service
        documentation to meet regulatory requirements.
      theSolution: The INSHIP model can be tailored to meet any customer need. For
        this customer, INSHIP added additional document types to the system,
        while providing new routing for these non-standard documents. Now the
        company’s suppliers e-mail their own standard documents to an INSHIP
        e-mail account. INSHIP extracts the documents and forwards the backup
        documents to a searchable file. Matching invoices are automatically
        approved while unmatched invoices and proforma invoices are forwarded
        for approval or rejection - all while keeping the supplier informed as
        to how each invoice is progressing.
      clientFeedback: “In the first few weeks after we started to use INSHIP, I was
        really surprised to hear that we were processing over 400 documents in a
        week - the system worked so well it really felt like 100 or less!
        Operators love using the system. It allows them to work in a structured
        way and to communicate with their colleagues and suppliers painlessly.
        We were surprised and delighted that INSHIP could integrate with our
        bespoke accounts system.”
    - title: Irish Hire Company
      theIssue: The company is a medium size hire company which receives approximately
        400 invoices a month.
      theBrief: The Managing Director (MD) required the ability to approve invoices
        from a number of suppliers once they had been actioned by her staff.
        This was to ensure all tasks had been completed correctly.
      theSolution: Using the standard INSHIP system, we advised this client to
        activate the ‘last approver’ option. This will ensure that any document
        (even those with a number of approvers, including the MD herself) may be
        reviewed lastly by the MD who is now able to confirm that the correct
        actions have been taken.
      clientFeedback: “Now I know the process is being followed, I can see who is
        doing what. My staff find the system really easy to use and the
        automatic statement reconciliation has improved our month end accounts.
        INSHIP is saving the company money each week by ensuring all charges are
        dealt with correctly.”
    - title: Stacks Pharmacy
      clientFeedback: Suppliers benefit because they no longer have to post costly
        paper invoices, nor re-print and re-post duplicates if they are
        required. Too, the data and processes provided by the Smart Office AP
        system ensures that as long as invoices are accurate, suppliers are paid
        within agreed terms — a benefit that has increased goodwill between
        critical suppliers and the Group.“With Smart Office AP, we save 90
        percent of the time we had historically spent processing supplier
        invoices,” the Group Managing Director observes. “The Smart Office
        application gives me the visibility I require to control my suppliers’
        paperwork, while allowing me to know at any moment in time what my
        outstanding debts are, no matter where in the world the physical
        invoices are located, or if they’ve been processed or not. “Smart Office
        enables Stacks Pharmacy Group to better serve our suppliers, and through
        them, our end-customers who rely on our suppliers’ crucial products.”
      theSolution: "Founded in 2000 by owner and managing director Ade Stack (MPSI),
        Stacks Pharmacy Group has grown exponentially. The company now
        incorporates seventeen pharmacy outlets located across Ireland, as well
        as Care Home Services, which serves the Irish nursing care sector with
        quality medication management services. Since its foundation, Stacks has
        been driven by the founder’s vision of quality, friendliness, and trust
        — not only to the customers her pharmacies serve, but also to the
        suppliers with whom her organisation engages. The Challenge — Coping
        with 7,000 Invoices Every Month The timely delivery of medications and
        other goods to each Stacks Pharmacy outlet is crucial because customers’
        lives can depend on them. Historically, Stacks used a manual process to
        manage the mountain of invoices it received from multiple suppliers.
        When goods were delivered to separate Stacks locations, they were
        accompanied by line-itemed invoices. Local Stacks Pharmacy employees
        checked the goods received against relevant invoice paperwork. Having
        approved the invoices, every week each store couriered that paperwork to
        the Stacks Dublin-based Head Office for processing and payment. There,
        it was the full-time job for a single Group employee to manually sort
        through and process the four full boxes of invoices received every
        month. Each supplier invoice, and every line item on it, had to be keyed
        in to the Group’s Sage 50c accounting software system, itself a slow and
        tedious process. Often, supplier invoices and statements could be
        missing. In that event, the Stacks accounts payable officer had to
        contact those specific suppliers to post replacement copies of the
        paperwork. Delayed documentation could result in late payments to
        suppliers, a situation Stacks Pharmacy always tried to avoid. Monthly
        supplier statements would also have to be manually reconciled. Due to
        the significant amount of time spent on manual processing, the accounts
        payable officer had little time to examine pricing and compare them to
        past invoices. For that reason, inadvertent overcharges could sometimes
        slip through.  Adding to its processing costs was the fact that all
        those physical paper invoices had to be stored somewhere.  “The manual
        system was cumbersome,” reflects Managing Director Ade Stack. “It is
        very important to keep our suppliers happy by paying them on-time and
        within their terms because we respect their efforts, and our customers
        rely on their products.  “However, our manual processes could
        occasionally delay payments, while sometimes allowing inaccurately
        priced invoices to go unnoticed. I recognised that we needed a more
        efficient system to streamline our accounts payable process.” The
        Solution: Smart Office AP Automated Accounts Payable Processing To
        resolve the company’s challenges, the Stack Pharmacy Group replaced its
        manual supplier invoice processing workflow with Smart Office AP. Fully
        integrated with the Group’s Sage 50c accounting solution, Smart Office
        AP automates the entire accounts payable management process using
        seamless, digital online technologies. While goods are still delivered
        directly to all seventeen Stacks Pharmacy outlets, suppliers now email
        invoices to a secure Smart Office AP online portal specifically designed
        for, and allocated to, the Stacks Pharmacy Group. There, the Smart
        Office system ‘grabs’ each invoice and extracts all required data
        including supplier name, line-itemed product names and codes, pricing,
        and the outlet which received the goods. Digitized copies of the
        invoices are pushed to the relevant pharmacy outlet for approval.
        Simultaneously, that data is migrated to the Group’s Sage Accounts
        system for financial processing and analysis. The Smart Office AP system
        automatically compares invoiced pricing with past pricing. Should the
        system notice a discrepancy, it notifies the Group managing director as
        well as accounts payable staff. Supplier statements are also
        automatically reconciled with invoices received. Should an invoice be
        missing, the system prompts the accounts payable officer to ask the
        supplier to email the missing document.  The new Smart Office AP
        solution has also resulted in additional savings by dispensing with the
        requirement to courier invoices from pharmacy outlets to the Group’s
        Head Office, and to store that growing mountain of paperwork. If Group
        Finance needs to find a specific invoice, the Smart Office AP online
        application facilitates easy document searches, while securely storing
        all invoices and statements for at least seven years. Streamlining the
        AP Process with 24/7 Visibility  Stacks Pharmacy Group, as well as its
        suppliers, have benefited significantly from automated accounts payable
        processing. Because AP workflows are fully automated, the Group’s
        accounts payable officer can spend more time examining pricing in
        detail, ensuring that invoices are accurate and that supplier payments
        are made within agreed terms. The Group has reduced its physical
        handling of 7,000 paper invoices per month down to almost nil. Because
        the time-consuming chore of handling paper invoices has been reduced,
        the time it takes to manage accounts payable has also been reduced. The
        Group also saves on physical paperwork storage because it is no longer
        required. Automated migration of accounts payable data to the Group’s
        Sage Accounts system minimizes data entry requirements as well as the
        possibility of human error, while the likelihood of paying inadvertent
        supplier overcharges has also been reduced. "
      theIssue: "Challenge: manual accounts payable processing was a time-consuming,
        expensive chore which delivered inefficient management of critical
        supplier invoices.  The Challenge — Coping with 7,000 Invoices Every
        Month"
      theBrief: Deliver a solution that:- •	90 percent time savings compared to manual
        systems •	Reduces supplier invoice processing costs by an estimated 85
        percent •	Automatically ‘flags’ invoiced pricing that is different to
        past invoiced prices. •	Reduces manual processing of 7,000 paper
        invoices per month to almost nil, replacing them with digitized copies
        •	Automatic statement reconciliation •	Suppliers no longer send in paper
        invoices (or copies, if required), avoiding print, postage, and handling
        costs •	Full integration with Sage Accounts automatically migrates
        invoice data for efficient financial processing  •	Always-on, secure
        visibility of all invoices from every supplier •	Seamless process
        increases AP accuracy and payment process tracking
