      # Moving from Manual To Automatic


      ## "Our Process is unique"


      Processing invoices manually is a costly and timely process that typically
      involves 8 to 10 steps. It has been proven that automating this process
      can reduce processing time by 80-90%, making it obvious as to why business
      are looking at an automated solution for this problem.


      Our customers can be concerned about automating a process that may seem
      complex or "unique" but with InShip we focus on providing a flexible
      system that can be simply tailored to meet different businesses different
      needs.


      As you are probably aware, AP is a hot topic and more and more customers
      are beginning to investigate automation options. This leaves ERP and
      Accountancy Software providers with a number of options: 


      * Build their own solution; a timely and costly exercise, generally taking
      up to two years to deliver and two million dollars to execute.

      * Allow users to integrate with various independent AP solutions; leaving
      you with little to no control and a poor revenue model.

      * Do nothing;  risking the loss of current customers and potential new
      customers.
