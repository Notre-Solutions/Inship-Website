      # Moving from Manual To Automatic


      ## "Our Process is unique"


      Processing invoices manually is a costly and timely process that typically
      involves 8 to 10 steps. It has been proven that automating this process
      can reduce processing time by 80-90%, making it obvious as to why business
      are looking at an automated solution for this problem.


      Our customers can be concerned about automating a process that may seem
      complex or "unique" but with InShip we focus on providing a flexible
      system that can be simply tailored to meet different businesses different
      needs.


      As you are probably aware, AP is a hot topic and more and more customers
      are beginning to investigate automation options. This leaves ERP and
      Accountancy Software providers with a number of options: 


      * Build their own solution; a timely and costly exercise, generally taking
      up to two years to deliver and two million dollars to execute.

      * Allow users to integrate with various independent AP solutions; leaving
      you with little to no control and a poor revenue model.

      * Do nothing;  risking the loss of current customers and potential new
      customers.

      * **Install an InShip module at a fraction of the time and cost of
      building your own system, giving you total control of both the process and
      the revenue and ensuring retention of current customers and enhancing the
      attraction of your system for potential new clients.**
