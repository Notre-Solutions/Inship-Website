      # Moving from Manual To Automatic


      ## "Our Process is unique"


      Processing invoices manually is a costly and timely process that typically involves 8 to 10 steps. It has been proven that automating this process can reduce processing time by 80-90%, making it obvious as to why business are looking at an automated solution.


      You may be concerned about automating your process, as it may seem complex or "unique" but with InShip we focus on providing a flexible system that can be simply tailored to meet different businesses different needs.


      As you are probably aware, AP automation is a hot topic and more and more businesses beginning to investigate automation options. This leaves you with a number of options: 


      * Continue with the old fashion costly and timely method of manually handling invoices, with its various problems.

      * Use a data capture tool that barely extracts some of the details you want.

      * Install an expensive process that will take a number of years to produce a ROI.

      * **Install InShip's user friendly**

    - title: UK Maintenance Company
      theIssue: From its maintenance hub, this UK company supports over 5000 assets
        using a network of 250 suppliers located throughout the country, and
        handles 60 daily breakdowns, 100 services and 20 annual checks.
      theBrief: A system was required that could correctly deal with all the company’s
        supplier invoices and proforma invoices. The system also needed to
        automatically compare these invoices to purchase orders. Additionally,
        they required us to automatically recognise and store backup service
        documentation to meet regulatory requirements.
      theSolution: The INSHIP model can be tailored to meet any customer need. For
        this customer, INSHIP added additional document types to the system,
        while providing new routing for these non-standard documents. Now the
        company’s suppliers e-mail their own standard documents to an INSHIP
        e-mail account. INSHIP extracts the documents and forwards the backup
        documents to a searchable file. Matching invoices are automatically
        approved while unmatched invoices and proforma invoices are forwarded
        for approval or rejection - all while keeping the supplier informed as
        to how each invoice is progressing.
      clientFeedback: “In the first few weeks after we started to use INSHIP, I was
        really surprised to hear that we were processing over 400 documents in a
        week - the system worked so well it really felt like 100 or less!
        Operators love using the system. It allows them to work in a structured
        way and to communicate with their colleagues and suppliers painlessly.
        We were surprised and delighted that INSHIP could integrate with our
        bespoke accounts system.”
    - title: Irish Hire Company
      theIssue: The company is a medium size hire company which receives approximately
        400 invoices a month.
      theBrief: The Managing Director (MD) required the ability to approve invoices
        from a number of suppliers once they had been actioned by her staff.
        This was to ensure all tasks had been completed correctly.
      theSolution: Using the standard INSHIP system, we advised this client to
        activate the ‘last approver’ option. This will ensure that any document
        (even those with a number of approvers, including the MD herself) may be
        reviewed lastly by the MD who is now able to confirm that the correct
        actions have been taken.
      clientFeedback: “Now I know the process is being followed, I can see who is
        doing what. My staff find the system really easy to use and the
        automatic statement reconciliation has improved our month end accounts.
        INSHIP is saving the company money each week by ensuring all charges are
        dealt with correctly.”
