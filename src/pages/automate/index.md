      # Moving from Manual To Automatic


      ## "Our Process is unique"


      Processing invoices manually is a costly process that normally involves 8
      to 10 stages that are nearly all manual. It has been estimated that
      automating this process saves between 80 and 90% of the processing time.
      This is why business are looking a to automate this process and remove the
      paper.


      A very common concern we hear is "our process is unique", in reality there
      is normally a certain element of truth in that statement but with InShip
      we focused on providing a flexible system that can be simply tailored to
      meet most businesses needs.
