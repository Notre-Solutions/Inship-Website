      Accounts Payable is a very manual process, business received documents by
      post and email, they are then matched, sorted, approved by one or many
      people, entered into an accounting or e.r.p. system, then filed,
      reconciled and stored for years. <div>$yourparagraph</div> This process
      costs up to $4.50 per invoice (based on a pwc report), as all businesses
      are always looking for cost and efficiency improvements introducing a
      InShip process will reduce a 8-10 stage manual process to an automatic
      that is  up to 9 times faster and removed between 80% and 90% of the cost.
