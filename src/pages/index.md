      Accounts Payable is a very manual and expensive process. Processing each
      invoice or bill can include up to ten steps and costs around â‚¬4.50 (based
      on a pwc report).  However if a business automates this process they can
      remove 80-90% of that cost.


      InShip provide three end to end solutions, these solutions are built to
      meet the disparate needs of all businesses no matter their size be they
      sole traders or large multinationals.


      An automated process puts structure on an unstructured process while
      increasing efficiency, fool-proof, streamlined & controlled. 


      Removes the need for a business to handle, distribute, process, file &
      store paper invoices but still giving the business the flexibility to
      handle the documents online as their business requires. 


      InShip can deliver a customized solution in 8 to 12 weeks that will suit
      the needs of most accounting software or erp solutions, at a price that is
      a fraction of your development cost plus a recurring cost less they your
