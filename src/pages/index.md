          each invoice or bill can include up to ten steps and costs around
          €4.50 (based on a pwc report).  However if a business automates this
          process they can remove 80-90% of that cost.

          to meet the disparate needs of all businesses no matter their size be
          they sole traders or large multinationals.

          handle the documents online as their business requires.
