          In most companies their current paper based system of handling
          invoices comes with an array of issues:


          1. Envelopes must be opened.

          2. Emails must be printed.

          3. Invoices need to be matched and sorted.

          4. Invoices need to get approvals.

          5. Manually entered on a computer system.

          6. Emails must be reconciled to statements and filed. 


          This is timely and expensive process ; in fact processing one invoice or bill can include as many as ten steps, costing approximately €4.50 (source: pwc). 


          If a business automates this process, 80-90% of that cost can be removed.  


          Along with standard processing invoices get miss laid, management may require files to be searched to obtain copy invoices for detailed review.
