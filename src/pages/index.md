        description: >-
          Accounts Payable is a very manual and expensive process. Processing
          each invoice or bill can include up to ten steps and costs around
          €4.50 (based on a pwc report).  However if a business automates this
          process they can remove 80-90% of that cost.


          InShip provide three end to end solutions, these solutions are built
          to meet the disparate needs of all businesses no matter their size be
          they sole traders or large multinationals.

          increasing efficiency, fool-proof, streamlined & controlled.

          store paper invoices but still giving the business the flexibility to
          handle the documents online as their business requires.

          Accounts Payable is timely and expensive; processing one invoice or
          bill can include as many as ten steps, costing approximately €4.50
          (source: pwc).  If a business automates this process, 80-90% of that
          cost can be removed.


          The current paper based system of handling documents comes with an
          array of issues; documents must be stored, managed and matched. Over
          time, this can lead to lost and degraded documents, taking up
          substantial space or racking up storage costs. This taxing process
          often results in focus being placed on completing the task rather than
          verification of the invoice. 


          In the majority of large organisations, their AP structure is
          unstructured with simple workarounds.

          pushing the invoice and it's data in an editable draft form to your

          confirm, edit, store and search for invoices. After invoices are
          approved, the data is pushed to the accounting system, removing the
          need to store invoices images in your system.

          accounts payable department, allowing businesses to replicate the
          complex AP process and automate it. This full systems includes PO

          approval, statement reconciliation among many others.
