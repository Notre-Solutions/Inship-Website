        text: InShip links with many PO systems (Sage, Intact etc.). However some
          businesses require a supplementary/different system, where InShip is
          the solution. Our system can work as a stand alone PO system or in
          addition to your ERP or account software PO system. The PO system can
          be set up with simple/complex approval processes, for example;
          automatically routing PO approvals based on suppliers items purchases
          or values.
