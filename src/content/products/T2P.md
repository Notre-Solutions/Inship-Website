        Accounts Payable is a very manual process, business received documents
        by post and email, they are then matched, sorted, approved by one or
        many people, entered into an accounting or e.r.p. system, then filed,
        reconciled and stored for years. This process is costly (based on pwc
        report) costs up to $4.50 per invoice, as all businesses are always
        looking for cost and efficiency improvements introducing a InShip
        process will reduce a 8-10 stage manual process to an automatic that
        is up to 9 times faster and removed between 80% and 90% of the cost.
        Reduce processing costs significantly
