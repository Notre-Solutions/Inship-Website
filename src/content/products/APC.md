      Accounts Payable is a very manual process, business received documents
      by post and email, they are then matched, sorted, approved by one or
      many people, entered into an accounting or e.r.p. system, then filed,
      reconciled and stored for years. This process is costly (based on pwc
      report) costs up to $4.50 per invoice, as all businesses are always
      looking for cost and efficiency improvements introducing a InShip
      process will reduce a 8-10 stage manual process to an automatic that
      is up to 9 times faster and removed between 80% and 90% of the cost.
