      Accounts Payable is a very manual process, business received
      documents           by post and email, they are then matched, sorted,
      approved by one or           many people, entered into an accounting or
      e.r.p. system, then filed,           reconciled and stored for years. This
      process is costly (based on pwc           report) costs up to $4.50 per
      invoice, as all businesses are always           looking for cost and
      efficiency improvements introducing a InShip           process will reduce
      a 8-10 stage manual process to an automatic that           is up to 9
      times faster and removed between 80% and 90% of the cost.           Reduce
      processing costs significantly
