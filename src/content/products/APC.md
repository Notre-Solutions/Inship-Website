APC is a solution that can be integrated with your current accounting software offering(s) both online and desk top. 

With APC, we can email or have the suppliers email Invoice and Credit Notes to a defined email address using a  domain created and controlled for you, documents can also dragged and dropped in the system. 

Using our AI process APC grabs the key fields of an Invoice or Credit Note and pushes them along with an image of the document (quality an size agreed). This data is transmitted as draft for the user to approve and convert to a full Accounts Payable Invoice or Credit Note.

APC can be localized for any market and data capture can be adjusted to meet you and your users need. 

The system learns and improves as your users use the module. Using the module fully users save over 90% of the processing time.
