    - title: Getting Invoices into the System
      description: >-
        The first step in the APC is for the invoice to be received into the
        system. InShip currently offer 2 methods for users to send their
        Invoices/Bills and Credit Note into the system, that is via a dedicated
        email address or via drag and drop (dnd). 


        Users best option is to get their suppliers to send invoices direct to
        the email account. This removes the need to scan documents or forward
        emails.
    - title: 'Automatic data capture '
      description: >-
        After documents are sent into APC, we use 5 methods to read each
        documents and then our AI system extracts relevant data (this can be
        globally to a system).


        The data is validated based both on standard rules and rules specific to
        individual systems and/or locations.
    - title: Data and document transfer
      description: >-
        After documents have been read and data captured, both the document and
        data is transferred to your accounting system based on an agreed method.


        This is transferred in a draft state.
    - title: Approval in your system
      description: >-
        After both the document and data have been received in your system, user
        approve invoice and edit them if required. Certain edits can be
        communicated back to APC to improve future auto processing.
