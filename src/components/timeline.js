          Accounts Payable is a very manual process, business received documents

          reconciled and stored for years. This process is costly (based on pwc
          report) costs up to $4.50 per invoice, as all businesses are always
          looking for cost and efficiency improvements introducing a InShip
          process will reduce a 8-10 stage manual process to an automatic that
          is up to 9 times faster and removed between 80% and 90% of the cost.
